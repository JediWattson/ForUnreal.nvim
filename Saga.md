# Planning Strat

1. Build with the Unreal engine in NeoVim
    - Create command that calls the build
    - check if config file exists
    - if not prompt user for path to engine
    - check path, determine if multiple engines exist
    - if multiple prompt user to pick one
    - if only one then choose that
    - check current project path - user MUST be in root of project for this build
    - build project
